# drumline-analysis

Currently a simple script for analyzing a recording of marching snare music. To use, change INTENDED_BPM, INTENDED_RHYTHM, ensure the section of code which records audio is commented out and SECONDS is set appropriately, and run the script. It will record your audio indicated by the terminal prompt and a .wav file will be generated and analyzed. You'll recieve a friendly matplotlib chart with insights into your rhythmic accuracy and volume. The blue hashes indicate the mathematically perfect rhythm while the red indicate what you played. Stats are present related to your error.
